# ReduxNewsReader
---
### codecademy project

This project—a news reader in which users can view and comment on various articles—gives you an opportunity to practice using Redux Toolkit’s createAsyncThunk and createSlice utilities to add asynchronous functionality to your Redux applications.

Currently, the app fetches and displays a list of all articles in their preview form. It also fetches and displays the current article, which can be selected and changed by the user.
